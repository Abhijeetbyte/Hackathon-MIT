# **Project Proposal: Web/Mobile Water Supply Mapping Tool**

<br/>
<br/>

## **Problem Statement**

**Problem Statement ID:** 1423

**Title:** Enhancing Water Supply Network Mapping

**Description:** The Jal Jeevan Mission aims to deliver clean drinking water reliably to every rural household. To achieve this vision, we require an innovative, cost-effective technology solution. Our goal is to develop a web/mobile-based tool for mapping water supply networks. This tool will create a comprehensive geospatial database of critical water supply infrastructure, incorporate grievance redressal mechanisms, and integrate an IoT system for alert monitoring.

**Organization:** Ministry of Jal Shakti

## **Solution Overview**

### **Approach:**
- **Design, Development, Testing, and Deployment**

### **Design:**
- **Platform:** Web (current)
- **Geospatial Data Collection:** Leveraging GPS devices or existing GIS data, user-generated data by allowing users to input  spatial coordinates (latitude, longitude).Creating a form for data submission and implementing validation. To show the location and distribution of water supply infrastructure.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Harnessing the power of QGIS (open source), water supply networks by mapping the systems of pipes.
- **Geospatial Database:** Organized collection of information related to water supply infrastructure. It includes data such as the location, type, condition, and capacity. Adding a geospatial component to each piece of data is associated with its precise geographic coordinates, allowing it to be mapped and analyzed in the context of its physical location.
- **Grievance Redressal:** Implement a ticketing system to manage and track these grievances efficiently.
- **IoT Implementation:** Utilizing flow rate sensors, transmitting data via HTTP protocol, and employing ESP32/ATmega328p microcontrollers

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js for the backend) and PHP for web development
- **Database:** Initial use of NoSQL databases and CSV (comma-separated values), with a planned transition to PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **IoT Platform:** *ESP32/ARDUINO*

### **Prototype Development:**
- **Tests:** Crafting a basic version with core features, emphasizing geospatial data input and visualization, grievance reporting, and basic IoT data display
- **Iterations:** Iterative development with feature enhancements based on continuous user feedback

### **Data Management:**
- **Data Sources:** Utilizing geospatial data from government databases, satellite imagery, or user-generated data with longitude and latitude
- **Data Processing:** Developing PHP based on preprocessing to incoming data. This might involve cleaning and validating user-generated data or formatting data from government sources for storage.
- **Data Updates:** Ensuring regular updates of geospatial data for real-time accuracy, with automated data fetching and updating geospatial data from government databases at regular intervals for real-time accuracy, synchronization in future phases

### **User Experience:**
- **User Interface (UI):** A user-centric, responsive design ensuring seamless functionality on both web and mobile platforms
- **Usability Testing:** Conducting thorough usability tests with potential users to refine and optimize the user interface

### **Security and Privacy:**
- **Data Encryption:** Employing state-of-the-art HTTPS for secure data transmission and industry-standard encryption for sensitive data storage in subsequent stages
- **Access Control:** Implementing stringent user authentication and authorization for admin panel access, limiting data modification to authorized personnel
- **Data Privacy:** Complying with stringent data privacy regulations, ensuring responsible handling of user data with utmost care and consent
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing user authentication and authorization using PHP. Ensure that only authorized users can submit or access certain data.

### **Testing and Feedback:**
- **Testing:** Rigorous testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to identify and promptly address any bugs or issues
- **User Feedback:** Actively seeking and incorporating feedback from users and conducting beta testing involving real users throughout the development journey
